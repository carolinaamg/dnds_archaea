## Estimation of the ratio of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions of protein-coding genes.

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to estimate the dN/dS ratio on protein-coding genes of archeal genomes. This framework can is applicable to bacteria.  

Moreover, this repository provides example input files to go from genome files to the final statistical analyses to compare two models.  

## This repository is part of the book chapter: "Title", where we provide a detailed summary of the scripts and a step-by-step tutorial to estimate dN/dS.
