## A workflow for estimating the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions in core protein-coding genes

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to estimate the dN/dS ratio on protein-coding genes of archeal genomes. This framework is applicable to bacteria.  

Moreover, this repository provides example input files to go from genome files to the final statistical analyses to compare two models.   

Input example files (genomes) can be found in the following Zenodo repository: https://zenodo.org/records/10854407

Once downloaded, your .tar.gz can be unzipped as follows:

``
tar -xzvf Methanosarcina_genus_genomes.tar.gz 
``
     
and  

``
tar -xzvf Methanosarcina_mazei_genomes.tar.gz
``  

_In our tutorial, the resulting folders will be your input folders._

#### This repository is part of the book chapter: "Title", where we provide a detailed summary of the scripts shown above and a step-by-step tutorial to estimate dN/dS with the example genome files.
