## Estimation of the ratio of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions of protein-coding genes.

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to estimate the dN/dS ratio on protein-coding genes of archeal genomes. This framework is applicable to bacteria.  

Moreover, this repository provides example input files to go from genome files to the final statistical analyses to compare two models.  
Input example files can be found on the following Zenodo repository: https://zenodo.org/records/10854407

Once downloaded, .tar.gz can be unzipped as follows:

``
tar -xzvf Methanosarcina_genus_genomes.tar.gz  
tar -xzvf Methanosarcina_mazei_genomes.tar.gz
``
In our tutorial, the resulting folders will be your input folders. 

## This repository is part of the book chapter: "Title", where we provide a detailed summary of the scripts and a step-by-step tutorial to estimate dN/dS.
